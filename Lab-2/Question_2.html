        <p>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an academic subject comprising<br> 
            approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear<br>
             division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the <br>
             field of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are historically<br> 
             more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms),<br>
            and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture).</p>

        <p>Chess is a board game for two players. It is an abstract strategy game that<br>
             involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played<br>
              on a square board consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.<br>
              The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen<br>
              pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights,<br>
            and eight pawns, with each type of piece having a different pattern of movement.</p>
